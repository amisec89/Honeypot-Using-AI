	The heuristic engine used by an antimalware program might include rules for the following:
•	a program which tries to copy itself into other programs (in other words, a classic computer virus)
•	a program which tries to write directly to the disk
•	a program which tries to remain resident in memory after it has finished executing
•	a program which decrypts itself when run (a method often used by malware to avoid signature scanners)
•	a program which binds to a TCP/IP port and listens for instructions over a network connection (this is pretty much what a bot—also sometimes called drones or zombies—do)
•	a program which attempts to manipulate (copy, delete, modify, rename, replace and so forth) files which are required by the operating system
•	a program which is like programs already known to be malicious
