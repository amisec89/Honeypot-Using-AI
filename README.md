# Honeypot-Using-AI
Security Project for social media
Most attackers target client’s social media pages for mining confidential data and other malicious behavior. One of the most prevalent attacks for this purpose is phishing attack (Man in the Middle) which can be in form of fake likes, fake plugins or even fake offerings on one’s social media web page.
Honeypots are a decoy tool to distract/redirect an attacker from the main priority information to a fake server giving him/her an impression of a successful attack.
